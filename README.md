Design a polished, modern e-commerce website UI for "Sarita’s Collection" — a boutique online store selling women's apparel, accessories, and home décor. Create full-page mockups for desktop and mobile for these pages: Home, Category listing (Women, Accessories, Home & Living), Product detail page, Shopping cart, Checkout (shipping & payment), About, Contact, and Order confirmation. 

Style & Branding:
- Clean, airy layout with white space, soft rounded cards, and a minimal serif+sans type pairing.
- Color palette: warm cream background (#FFF8F2), charcoal text (#222), accent coral (#E06A5A) and muted gold (#D4B583).
- High-quality product imagery, large hero banner on Home, and card-based product grid.
- Prominent search bar and persistent top nav with logo left, categories center, account/cart icons right.
- Visible trust signals: secure checkout icon, accepted payment logos, short shipping/returns notes.
- Accessible (WCAG AA): high contrast text, large tap targets, keyboard focus, alt text placeholders.

Interactions & Components:
- Product grid with quick view hover, filters (size, color, price), and sort.
- Product page with image gallery, size selector, quantity, “Add to cart”, and recommended products carousel.
- Cart drawer that can open from any page showing items, editable quantities, subtotal, promo code input, and CTA to Checkout.
- Checkout: progressive form with shipping->payment->review steps; client-side validation; show shipping estimates.
- Microcopy: friendly, simple tone (e.g., “Sustainably sourced. Loved by you.”).

Deliverables:
- Responsive mockups (desktop, tablet, mobile) for each page listed.
- Component library (buttons, inputs, cards) and spacing/guideline sheet.
- Exportable assets and a short spec sheet for developers.
